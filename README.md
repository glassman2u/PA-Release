This is a text list of bad URL's (Adult/Porn/Malicious etc...) I made to be compatible with a Palo-Alto firewall's EDL (External Dynamic List) - you are free to take this and modify, use as your own etc...

More info on Palo Alto's EDL usage here: https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-admin/policy/use-an-external-dynamic-list-in-policy/external-dynamic-list
