This is a text list of bad URL's (Adult/Porn/Malicious etc...) I made to be compatible with a Palo-Alto firewall's EDL (External Dynamic List) - you are free to take this and modify, use as your own etc...

More info on Palo Alto's EDL usage here: https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-admin/policy/use-an-external-dynamic-list-in-policy/external-dynamic-list

DISCLAIMER:

I take absolutely ZERO responsibiltiy for the accuracy, usage, implications or otherwise usage of this list. Use at your own risk, it is not maintained nor is it 100% accurate at the time of publication. There are many other ways to accomplish this same list, probably better and easier to use - DO NOT EXPECT SUPPORT ON THIS LIST, NOR WILL I PROVIDE SUPPORT.


INSTALLATION:

Simply copy the URL for the "raw" version of the list to add to your Palo Alto firewall's EDL section - you should read the following to ensure you're aware of what you're doing:
